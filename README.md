# üè• Patient Management Microservices Platform

A production-grade microservices architecture built using Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, Docker, and AWS. This platform enables secure, scalable handling of patient data with real-time analytics, billing services, and authentication.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This system is composed of four core services:
- **Patient Service** ‚Äì Manages patient records and CRUD operations.
- **Auth Service** ‚Äì Centralized JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- **Billing Service** ‚Äì gRPC service for invoice generation and payment tracking.
- **Analytics Service** ‚Äì Consumes Kafka events for real-time health data insights.

All services communicate over REST/gRPC and are containerized via Docker.
